# Java-Algogen (Java algorithm generator)
<font style = "color: silver;">Last updated on 13 Jan, 2021</font>
<br><font style = "color: red;"><b>PROJECT INCOMPLETE. WORK IN PROGRESS!</b></font>
<br>A project to 'help' the 'needy' to convert their Java code into an algorithm document. 
The software only supports one kind of algorithm format yet. 
Plans to add more formats is not under consideration yet (that's all the yets you'll see).

## How to use?
- You need to [download the ZIP](https://github.com/OogleGlu/Java-Algogen/archive/main.zip). 
- Then extract it somewhere.
- Place folder containing your java source files in the `root` of the extracted directory.
- Execute the class `Main`. 
- Enter the source file path and the output will be generated as a `Class_Algo.txt` in the `Algos` directory of `root`.

## How will we 'help' the needy?
The [CISCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_the_Indian_School_Certificate_Examinations) board computer science students require to 
make projects where they code about 20 complex programs in Java. 
Then they are required to document the code using:
- Variable description charts
- Different I/O
- Algorithm

## Remember
<em>"A programming language is for thinking about programs, 
not for expressing programs you've already thought of. 
It should be a pencil, not a pen."<br>

## Who are the 'needy'?
As of 12th Jan of 2021, we ([we who?](https://github.com/OogleGlu)) have just recovered from writing about 20 algorithms 
for our [ISC-Computer-Practical](https://github.com/OogleGlu/ISC-Computer-Practical) in a single night for submission to school. 
Why? Coz we are lazy enough to not do a day's work in that day. This project is intended to save such lazy people.<br>

## Hence,
We decided to automate the ugliest part of the documentation process, 
i.e. rewriting 20 codes as an algorithm.

## Note
We will continue updating the format to make the algorithm look 
more human-made. If the board changes the style of algorithm, we'll 
change ours to fit theirs.

## Contribute
 - Remember to comment lavishly in the `pull request` discussion page what changes you have made and why they were necessary when opening a `pull request`
 - If you have a GitHub account and are not an owner of this repository, `fork` this repository and contribute the usual way.
 - If you are one of the repository owners, please `DO NOT` commit directly to `master` or `main`. Leave it for the finalised version.
 - Please `create a branch` and commit there, then open a `pull request`, and then usual `merging` will take place.

## Note for owners
Remember to mention your name while commenting in pull requests, issues, etc, or participating in a GitHub discussion.
This way others who own it will know who are commenting.
